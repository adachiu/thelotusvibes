      <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
      <p>Hi, I'm Ada Chiu, creator of The Lotus Vibes. I'm on a journey to live a mindful, happy and healthy life, inspired by Buddhist philosophies. Throughout this lifelong journey, I will document my progress as I learn more about Buddhism and apply my learnings toward daily life activities. By being unaffiliated with any particular teacher or lineage, my views are independent for exploring Buddhism.</p>

      <h2>Why are you doing this?</h2>
      <p>In early 2016, I experienced a traumatic event which led me to believe that I would lose my vision. When doctors were unable to diagnose my condition, I felt frustrated and helpless, to say the least. I underwent medical examinations that included CT scan, chest X-ray, blood tests, a <a href="http://www.webmd.com/brain/lumbar-puncture#1" target="_blank">lumbar puncture</a> (ouch), and a <a href="http://www.healthline.com/health/fluorescein-angiography#Purpose2" target="_blank"> fluorescein angiography</a>. After a few long days, a neuro-ophthalmologist conclusively told me that I was born with an abnormally narrow optic nerve. It led to a blood vessel hemorrhage, which caused a temporary visual disturbance in one eye. Thankfully, I recovered shortly within two weeks and could see very clearly ever since. Despite this ordeal, it led to profound self-realization and self-clarity. I'm grateful for the hardships I faced because it gave me perspective, priorities, awakening and purpose to go on a quest for mindfulness.</p>

      <h2>What is mindfulness?</h2>
      <p>Mindfulness is about being in the present moment instead of dwelling on the past or worrying about the future. To achieve mindfulness, it requires constant nurturing.</p>

      <h2>Why is it "The Lotus Vibes?"</h2>
      <p>In Buddhist symbolism, the lotus symbolizes purity of the body, speech, and mind. The Lotus Vibes is about cultivating positivity and mindfulness with the influence of Buddhist teachings.</p>
